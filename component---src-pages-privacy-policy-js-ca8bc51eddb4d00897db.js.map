The Products use Baidu code to gather\n          statistical information. Baidu sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of visitors to the\n          Products and the volumes of usage of the Products. This is done to ensure that the Products are available when\n          you want them and are fast.</p>\n        <p>The Products use Microsoft App Center code to gather statistical information. Microsoft App Center sets\n          cookies\n          to help us accurately estimate the number of visitors to the Products and the volumes of usage of the\n          Products.\n          This is done to ensure that the Products are available when you want them and are fast.</p>\n\n        <h2>MOBILE ANALYTICS</h2>\n        <p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on\n          your phone. This software may record information such as how often you engage with the Products, the events\n          that\n          occur within the Products, aggregated usage and performance data, and where the Applications were downloaded\n          from.\n          We may link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit\n          within\n          the mobile application.</p>\n\n        <h2>LOG FILES</h2>\n        <p>As true of most websites, we gather certain information and automatically and store it in log files. This\n          information may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),\n          referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.</p>\n        <p>If you receive the HTML-formatted version of our email newsletter, your opening of the newsletter is notified\n          to\n          us and saved.

WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>\n        <p>All information you provide to us through the Products is stored on our secure servers located in the US. Any\n          payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology; all payment information is stored with our\n          payment\n          processor and is never stored on Color Collect’s servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a\n          password which enables you to access certain parts of the Products, you are responsible for keeping this\n          password\n          confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone, and suggest that your change your password\n          frequently.</p>\n        <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do\n          our\n          best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to\n          the\n          Products; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict\n          procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>\n\n        <h2>6. CORPORATE AND OTHER COMMUNITY SHARING</h2>\n        <p>There is interest by large consumer communities (companies, universities, hospitals, etc.) (“Communities”) to\n          introduce the Products to their employees and members. If you have registered to use the Products through a\n          code\n          or other registration credential furnished by a Community (a “Community Subscription”), the Community will\n          have\n          access to your name and the date you registered to use the Products and will have access to your usage\n          information\n          on an aggregated basiswith all other members of the Community that are using the Products. Your Community may\n          also\n          have access to your usage information on an individual basis if you have provided appropriate consent under\n          applicable law for such sharing. For example, many employers are offering incentive programs based on employee\n          participation in health & wellness programs and desire to better understand how each of their individual\n          employees\n          is using the Products.</p>\n\n        <h2>7.

Services like Facebook Connect\n          give\n          you to the option to post information about your activities on our Products or to your profile page to share\n          with\n          others within your network.</p>\n\n        <h2>8.
